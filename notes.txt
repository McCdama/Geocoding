a single string to decode function or: DataFrame from panda bundle
--> query (str) â€“ The address or query you wish to geocode.

Arabic support for only pre-titeld/definded arabic places! 

4- Payant ou pas?
Geocoding is provided by a number of different services, 
which are not affiliated with geopy in any way. 
These services provide APIs, which anyone could implement, 
and geopy is just a library which provides these implementations for many different services in a single package.
